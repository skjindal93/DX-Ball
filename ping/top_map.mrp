NOTES:

   Related logic is defined as being logic that shares connectivity - e.g. two
   LUTs are "related" if they share common inputs.  When assembling slices,
   Map gives priority to combine logic that is related.  Doing so results in
   the best timing performance.

   Unrelated logic shares no connectivity.  Map will only begin packing
   unrelated logic into a slice once 99% of the slices are occupied through
   related logic packing.

   Note that once logic distribution reaches the 99% level through related
   logic packing, this does not mean the device is completely utilized.
   Unrelated logic packing will then begin, continuing until all usable LUTs
   and FFs are occupied.  Depending on your timing budget, increased levels of
   unrelated logic packing may adversely affect the overall timing performance
   of your design.

Section 2 - Warnings
--------------------
WARNING:LIT:243 - Logical network speed has no load.
WARNING:LIT:175 - Clock buffer is designated to drive clock loads. BUFGMUX
   symbol "physical_group_XLXN_38/XLXI_22/CLOCK_GEN/PIXEL_CLOCK_BUF" (output
   signal=XLXN_38) has a mix of clock and non-clock loads. Some of the non-clock
   loads are (maximum of 5 listed):
   Pin I0 of XLXI_14/cd1/counter1/counterout_and00001
   Pin I0 of XLXI_14/cd1/counter1/counterout_1__and00011
   Pin I1 of XLXI_14/cd1/counter1/counterout_0__and00001

   Pin I0 of XLXI_14/cd1/counter1/counterout_2__and00011
WARNING:PhysDesignRules:372 - Gated clock. Clock net XLXI_14/cr<1> is sourced by
   a combinatorial pin. This is not good design practice. Use the CE pin to
   control the loading of data into the flip-flop.
WARNING:PhysDesignRules:372 - Gated clock. Clock net XLXI_14/cr<5> is sourced by
   a combinatorial pin. This is not good design practice. Use the CE pin to
   control the loading of data into the flip-flop.
WARNING:PhysDesignRules:372 - Gated clock. Clock net XLXI_14/cr<4> is sourced by
   a combinatorial pin. This is not good design practice. Use the CE pin to
   control the loading of data into the flip-flop.
WARNING:PhysDesignRules:372 - Gated clock. Clock net XLXI_14/cr<2> is sourced by
   a combinatorial pin. This is not good design practice. Use the CE pin to
   control the loading of data into the flip-flop.
WARNING:PhysDesignRules:372 - Gated clock. Clock net XLXI_14/cr<6> is sourced by
   a combinatorial pin. This is not good design practice. Use the CE pin to
   control the loading of data into the flip-flop.
WARNING:PhysDesignRules:372 - Gated clock. Clock net XLXI_14/cr<3> is sourced by
   a combinatorial pin. This is not good design practice. Use the CE pin to

Section 3 - Informational
-------------------------
INFO:MapLib:562 - No environment variables are currently set.
INFO:MapLib:863 - The following Virtex BUFG(s) is/are being retargeted to
   Virtex2 BUFGMUX(s) with input tied to I0 and Select pin tied to constant 0:
   BUFG symbol "XLXI_22/CLOCK_GEN/PIXEL_CLOCK_BUF" (output signal=XLXN_38),
   BUFG symbol "XLXI_22/CLOCK_GEN/SYS_CLOCK_BUF" (output
   signal=XLXI_22/CLOCK_GEN/system_clock_buffered),
   BUFG symbol "XLXI_4/ad_BUFG" (output signal=XLXI_4/ad),
   BUFG symbol "XLXI_4/clkslow2_BUFG" (output signal=XLXI_4/clkslow2)
INFO:LIT:244 - All of the single ended outputs in this design are using slew
   rate limited output drivers. The delay on speed critical single ended outputs
   can be dramatically reduced by designating them as fast outputs in the
   schematic.
INFO:PhysDesignRules:772 - To achieve optimal frequency synthesis performance
   with the CLKFX and CLKFX180 outputs of the DCM comp
   XLXI_22/CLOCK_GEN/SYSTEM_DCM/XLXI_22/CLOCK_GEN/SYSTEM_DCM, consult the device
   Interactive Data Sheet.
